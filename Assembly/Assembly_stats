Assembly Stats

This program is to analyze basic data about your fasta/fastq files. Assembly Stats gives you the following information about 
your fasta/fastq files:

Sum = (number of nucleotides contained within your file/files), n = (number of contigs/files), ave = (average size of contigs or files), 
largest = (largest contig/file size, N50 = (N50 of your Fasta/fastq files), N60 = (N60 of your Fasta/fastq files), 
N70 = (N70 of your Fasta/fastq files), N80 = (N80 of your Fasta/fastq files), N90 = (N90 of your Fasta/fastq files), 
N100 = (N100 of your Fasta/fastq files), N_count = (N count), Gaps = (number of any run of Ns of any length)

usage: stats [options] <list of fasta/q files>

Reports sequence length statistics from fasta and/or fastq files

options: -l Minimum length cutoff for each sequence. Sequences shorter than the cutoff will be ignored [1] -s Print 'grep friendly' 
output -t Print tab-delimited output -u Print tab-delimited output with no header line -v Print version and exit
