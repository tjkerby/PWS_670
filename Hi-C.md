# Visualizing Hi-C Scaffolds in Juicebox

In order to visualize your Hi-C scaffolds in Juicebox, you need to run convert.sh. This script needs a .jar file that is part of Juicertools.  

The .jar file can be found here: https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/wiki/Download
The script for convert.sh can be found here: https://github.com/marbl/SALSA/blob/master/convert.sh .

Run convert.sh from the command line like this:
        convert.sh <scaffolds>
Where <scaffolds> is the output directory you specified in SALSA.
